- [SDL2_mixer sample](https://github.com/aminosbh/sdl2-mixer-sample) \[[@aminosbh](https://github.com/aminosbh)\]:<br>
  This project is a basic sample written in C that demonstrates the usage of the
  SDL2 and SDL2_mixer libraries. It uses CMake as a build system.
  This program will start playing waves sound that can be paused/resumed by
  pressing the SPACE key. When one of the arrows keys is pressed a sound effect
  is played parallelly with the waves sound.
  It contains build instructions and explains how to open it with an IDE.

  This project is a basic C SDL2 project that uses CMake as a build system.<br>
  It draws the flag of Tunisia using basic graphics primitives.<br>
  It contains build instructions and explains how to open it with an IDE.

- [Basic C SDL2 game](https://github.com/aminosbh/basic-c-sdl-game) \[[@aminosbh](https://github.com/aminosbh)\]:<br>
  This project is a basic C SDL2 game that uses CMake as a build system.<br>
  It shows how we can develop a basic grid-based game.<br>
  It contains build instructions and explains how to open it with an IDE.
